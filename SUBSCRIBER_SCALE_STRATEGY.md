# Subscriber Scale Strategy — Product Decision Doc

## YouTube Outlier Finder

### Why this document exists

To resolve how subscriber size should be handled without diluting the core value proposition:

**Finding ideas that win on their own merit — not because of fame.**

This document defines:

- how small vs large channels are treated
- how flexibility is offered safely
- how this strengthens monetisation instead of weakening it

## Core Principle (Lock This In)

**Defaults protect trust. Options empower experts.**

We must:

- default to highly replicable signals
- allow advanced users to intentionally explore scale
- never mix these accidentally

## The Two Types of Signal (Critical Distinction)

### 1. Small / Micro Channel Outliers (Primary Signal)

**What they prove:**
The concept works without audience advantage.

- Low authority
- High replicability
- Best for small creators

**This is the core promise of the product.**

### 2. Large Channel Outliers (Secondary Signal)

**What they prove:**
The concept is so strong it broke the channel's own ceiling.

- High authority
- Lower replicability
- Best for trend study, not copying

**These are valuable — but only when clearly labeled.**

## The Final Strategy (Decision)

✅ Include large channels  
❌ Never show them by default  
✅ Treat them as a different class of evidence

## System Defaults (Non-Negotiable)

These apply automatically to every new user.

- **Default subscriber cap:** ≤ 50,000
- **Ranking priority:** Virality multiplier (efficiency), not raw views
- **Result framing:** "Replicable ideas first"

This ensures:

- trust on first use
- no confusion for small creators
- strong alignment with the product's promise

## User Controls (Pro Feature)

### Subscriber Cap Filter (Pro)

Users can intentionally expand scope.

Available options:

- ≤10k — Micro
- ≤50k — Small (default)
- ≤100k
- ≤250k
- ≤500k
- ≤1M+
- Unlimited

This supports:

- creator growth stages
- different niche scales
- advanced analysis

## Guardrails for Large Channels (Critical)

### 1. Advanced Toggle (Not Passive)

Large channels are enabled via an explicit toggle:

**"Include Scale-Up Channels (Advanced)"**

This prevents accidental misuse.

### 2. Visual Classification (Required)

Every result is labeled with replicability context:

- 🟢 **High Replicability**
  Channels under 50k — won with zero authority

- 🟡 **Mid-Range Signal**
  50k–250k — proven concept with some audience boost

- 🔵 **Scale-Up Signal**
  250k+ — strong trend, requires serious execution

This teaches users how to interpret results, not just consume them.

### 3. One-Time Warning (Friction with Purpose)

When enabling Scale-Up channels:

⚠️ **Larger channels included.**  
These results are best used for trend study, not direct replication.

## Why This Strengthens Monetisation

### Free

- Pure, replicable signal only
- No confusion
- Strong trust

### Pro

- Unlocks scale awareness
- Makes the tool feel smarter, not noisier
- Justifies higher pricing

**This turns the Subscriber Cap into your #1 upgrade lever.**

## Final Summary (Internal)

- **Default = ≤50k** (replicable wins)
- **Big channels = opt-in, labeled, contextual**
- **Ranking = efficiency first**
- **Education > restriction**

This preserves the brand while empowering power users.
